== Neo4j JDBC Driver

image:https://travis-ci.org/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc"]

This driver was mainly developed by http://larus-ba.it[Larus BA, Italy], a certified consulting and integration solutions partner for Neo4j.
*Thank you* so much for all your work.

This is the Neo4j JDBC driver that supports various types of database connections.
With this driver you will be able to interact with a Neo4J database using also the new BOLT protocol.

[NOTE]
The previous JDBC driver for Neo4j 2.x was moved to the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc-2x repository.

Being a graph database, Neo4J is not serving data in a relational way and the exact purpose of this project is to allow
projects that are using the classic JDBC connector in the relational paradigm to interact with Neo4J.

The driver can be used with:

* every kind of Neo4J server exposing services through the BOLT protocol (3.0.X)

The driver will be implemented also for:

* direct file connection
* embedded connection


This project is composed by the following modules:

* https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/tree/master/neo4j-jdbc[Neo4j JDBC] - the core module
* https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/tree/master/neo4j-jdbc-driver[Neo4j JDBC - Driver packaging] - module to package all above modules
* https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/tree/master/neo4j-jdbc-bolt[Neo4j JDBC - Bolt] - module supporting the bolt protocol
* https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/tree/master/neo4j-jdbc-http[Neo4j JDBC - Http] - module supporting the http protocol


=== Minimum viable snippet

---------------------------------------------
// Connect
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:neo4j:bolt://localhost");

// Querying
try (Statement stmt = con.createStatement()) {
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name");
	while (rs.next()) {
		System.out.println(rs.getString("n.name"));
	}
}
con.close();
---------------------------------------------

=== Usage

* Add the JDBC driver jar file to your project
* Execute queries using the Cyper graph query language

=== Tests usage

* Run all unitary tests & integration tests :
-------------------------------------------------
mvn clean test
-------------------------------------------------

* Run only integration tests:
-------------------------------------------------
mvn clean test -Pintegration-test
-------------------------------------------------

* Run performance tests:

--------------------------------------------------
mvn clean test -Pperformance-test
--------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Must have a neo4j (3.0.X) stand alone with Bolt protocol on port 7687 (default)

===== Server

* Install a Neo4j 3.0.X server and start it with the BOLT protocol enabled

* Connect with URLs in the form jdbc:neo4j:bolt://<host>:<port>/ e.g. jdbc:neo4j:bolt://localhost/

* You can also set comma separated parameters in the URL for authentication, debug mode and ssl encryption, e.g. jdbc:neo4j:bolt://localhost/?user=neo4j,password=neo4j,debug=true,noSsl
